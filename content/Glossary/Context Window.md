## Bigger Better Stronger

Context window is a limit on the text size an AI copilot can consider. Bigger is better.
By having a larger context limit the AI assistant should provide more relevant responses while minimizing repetition.

Usually, included in the context window are: previous questions and responses, key concepts identified in the conversation, user preferences and history.

But, this may also make assistants responses biased or inconsistent if the context window contains incorrect or incomplete information.
