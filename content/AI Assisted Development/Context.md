Depending on the type of the AI assistant you are using in order for it to give you a better answer it needs context.

As a starting point the name of the file, as well as the files extension, will already give your copilot an idea of what you want to achieve.

Some of other ways are:
- Having open tabs in your editor
- Defining a descriptive variable or function name
- Writing comments of desired outcome or a structure of an object
- Selecting a part of the code
- Using @, # and  / commands
