# GitHub Copilot

## What is GitHub Copilot?

It's a paid service from GitHub. An AI-powered developer tool that assists with code completions, chat-based assistance, etc. 

Based on GPT model from open AI that powers chat GPT. Trained on a vast amount of public code. The more popular the language is, the more useful it will be.

To use it, you need a subscription. Currently, generally available subscriptions are [[Copilot Individual]] and [[Copilot Business]]. With [[Copilot Enterprise]], which has a waitlist, coming in the future.
  
The way apps like copilot generally work is that the information is sent from the computer to the AI, and AI retains the information to train the language model.  
  
For example, the prompts that are generated when you pause while typing, prompts that are sent to the completions panel or prompts created in the chat are all retained. 
  
Unless you use [[Copilot Business]], in which case all the prompts are only transmitted in real time and are not retained.  
  
Some data is used by GitHub and Microsoft to improve and provide usage data to the service. So basically, a telemetry that is used to measure the impact of copilot on the users, sorting algorithms and prompt crafting, and to conduct research and experiments to improve how developers use the tools.
