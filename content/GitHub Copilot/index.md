# GitHub Copilot

## What?

Paid service from GitHub.

GitHub copilot is a code assistant that helps us write code faster. It's based on GPT model from open AI that powers chat GPT. But it's a focused Language Learning Model. Trained on a huge amount of public code. The more popular the language is, the more useful it will be.  
  
To use it, you need a subscription. Currently, generally available subscriptions are individual and business, with enterprise, which has a waitlist, coming in the future.  
  
The way it works is that the information is sent from the computer to the AI, and AI retains the information to train the language model.  
  
Prompts that are generated when you pause while typing, prompts that are sent to the completions panel or prompts created in the chat are all retained.  
  
Unless you use business copilot, in which case all the prompts are only transmitted in real time and are not retained.  
  
Some data is used by Github and Microsoft to improve and provide usage data to the service. So basically, a telemetry that is used to measure the impact of copilot on the users, sorting algorithms and prompt crafting, and to conduct research and experiments to improve how developers use the tools.
