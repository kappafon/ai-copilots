What I found AI coding assistants to be good for (so far):
- reducing time googling things, or narrowing down ideas on what to google
- acting out as a rubber ducky that can respond back
- cutting down time on repetitive patterns, generic [[Code Completions]] and some trivial things, regex
- explaining, simplifying, documenting, debugging (to a degree) of existing functions
- being useful when you know _what_ you want, but forgot exactly _how_ to do it
- generating simple unit tests, or suggesting what to test
- help out during refactoring (i.e. class to functional components)
- summarizing code changes into git messages
- deciphering console errors
